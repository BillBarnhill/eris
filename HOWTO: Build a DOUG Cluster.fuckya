Denny's Guide to Building a DOUG Cluster
Step 1) Create DOUG-v6.lll and copy the address
Step 2) Go into each of the following files:
-General-
repDB.lll

-Swarum-
Swarum.lll
Thread Factory.lll
Topic Factory.lll
Votable Post Factory.lll

-Bylaws-
CreateThread.lll
CreateTopic.lll
PostToThread.lll

near the top of each of these files is a line that reads

(def 'DOUG 0x9c0182658c9d57928b06d3ee20bb2b619a9cbf7b)

Copy DOUG's address from the previous step into every one of these slots

Step 3) Create all of those contracts. Order does not matter but contract numbers all get generated in the
same order on fresh blockchains so if you are going to do this a couple times without automation you can make
your life simpler by sticking to some order. As you create each contract note its address (you can copy to
the list below if that helps you will need them all) 

DOUG = 0x9c0182658c9d57928b06d3ee20bb2b619a9cbf7b
rep = 0x7ed820f11b6987139aeca5c0e38668ab089f7911
Swarum = 0x9e4d58a9f74d7a5752c712210a9ffbe612f2609f
Threadf = 0x540cfd9789ce49ccdc7c760ae5be640fb782109d
Topicf = 0xf65fc8cd2c6b427903e6eddb85ec8a5737566510
Postf = 0x644f87f92629c3856337722ad782ec41a20202c6

BLWCThread = 0xef9a9e3eaadf47b322b5111b85e6b569ad159664
BLWCTopic = 0x5b41a84c87d89b522279838a6fcb9a5ffa39dc6b
BLWPostTT = 0x6e1e9f93cd2bc9ba6678cf7d17ddea13acb19f57

Step 4) DOUG Registration:
Since there is no contract adding Bylaws yet we will do it manually. Don't worry by default the creator of 
DOUG gets "BYLAW" status allowing you to make any edits necessary The following list will help. Order does
not matter at all But all transactions must go to DOUG. ALSO you NEED to replace the addresses you obtained
for each contract---------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                                     V

Step 5) Give yourself some rep!
I have my address hardcoded to automatically give me 9001 rep but i don't remember which one you are using so you need to make the following transaction
to the rep contract:

"set" 0xYOURADDRESS 0x9001
if you want to hardcode yourself for the future you can add in a line in repDB.lll at line 37 like
[[0xYOURADDRESS]]0x9001

Step 6) You now have a functioning DOUG cluster with three bylaws!
the bylaws you have are:
CreateTopic API:(0xSwarumAddress "linkID" innerBlob innermodel innerUI outerBlob outermodel outerUI)
CreateThread API:(I forget look it up yourself :P)
PostToThread
Note I have only tested CreateTopic the others should work....

inner**** are the values which get placed in the c3d Header of the created thing whereas
outer**** are the values in the linked list which you link your created thing to.

Such Flexibility
Much horrible API

Step 7) Enjoy your new DOUG
Many DOUGs enjoy being played with consider taking your DOUG to the park or for a walk. Maybe play fetch or go swimming.
